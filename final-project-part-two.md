# User research 

## Target audience
For my target audience, I determined that I want to target theater executives and other stakeholders for movie theaters. Since my presentation and research focuses on movie theaters, the growth of streaming, and major events that lead to significant success in theater chains, I thought it made the most sense to target those in control of those chains. My call to action will be ways that they can improve their theaters to regain customers. So, to me it made the most sense to focus my target demographic on the decision makers for movie theaters.


## Interview script
For my interview, my goal is to ask people of varying demographics to review the Shorthand presentation and answer a short survey regarding its contents. I want to analyze the readability, effectiveness of graphs, as well as the overall effectiveness of the presentation.
