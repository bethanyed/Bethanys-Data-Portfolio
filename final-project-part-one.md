# Outline
For my final project, I want to create a breakdown of the creation of the film industry and the growth of movie theaters. I want to illustrate the importance of movie theaters as an experience and the benefits of seeing a film in theaters versus streaming. The final aspect will be what creates a good theater experience to encourage theaters to make adjustments to bring more foot traffic into movie theaters. This will be followed by a call to action to encourage people to go out to their local theater and see a film. I would like to create a map visual that shows the density of movie theaters so people can find ones local to them.

Structurally, I want to break my project into 3 sections. The first one is a summary of the film industry from its creation to now, showcasing important elements like when theaters were created and the first film to break $1 billion at the box office. Secondly, I want to show the changes in the industry, such as the introduction of streaming platforms and COVID-19s impact on theaters. For the 3rd section, it will focus on popular movies of the year and encourage people to go out to see a film in theaters.

# The data
During the first round of my research, I identified 5 sources that contain varying data about the top films, production of films, as well as some data about streaming services. I will use this data to compare the value of the streaming industry versus theaters. Also, I will utilize the data to show the top films so people can choose a recent release that may interest them. I also used Google Maps to find local movie theaters so I can create a heat map to show the locations of local theaters. On top of these 5 sources, I will extend my research further to find more data that helps illustrate the story.

# Method and medium
To create my project, I have broken it down into a series of steps to streamline the process and ensure my timing stays on track. For the first step, I am narrowing down my story to determine exactly what I want to say. I am then going to create a wireframe outline of my project with a few sketches of the data visualizations I would like to create to support my material. 

For the second step, I am going to research my topic and find sources to build my story around. In my research, I will focus on finding sources that contain the data needed for my visualizations. Then, once I have my specific data, I will start to build my story around it so I can tell a specific story that is truthful to its data. 

Once I have my data, I am going to utilize Tableau to build each of these graphs. I did 4 sketches of graphs with specific data I would like to utilize, though I may adjust the style depending on what data and information I find in my research. Utilizing these graphs, I will build a short presentation in Shorthand to show off my story as well as my data.
