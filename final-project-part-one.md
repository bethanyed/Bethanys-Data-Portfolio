# Outline
For my final project, I want to create a breakdown of the creation of the film industry and its growth over the years. The final aspect will be a top box office breakdown for the year 2025 to illustrate what the top films of the year are. This will be followed by a call to action to encourage people to go out to their local theater and see a film. I would like to create a map visual that shows the density of movie theaters so people can find ones local to them.
 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.  


# The data

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
