# Critique by Design

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization
[Link to Original Graph](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2016/mans-best-friend-global-pet-ownership-and-feeding-trends/#:%5C~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20people,likely%20to%20own%20a%20pet) 

When choosing a visual for this redesign, I was drawn to this one for several reasons. The first thing that caught my attention was the data. I have a lot of pets and it interested me to see the trends in pet ownership around the world. Secondly, while I thought the main information was portrayed well, I thought the rest of the graph seemed cluttered, so I thought that a redesign could help improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend.

## Step two: the critique
Overall, the colors were what mainly stood out to me, as well as the visual icons they utilized. I think having the averages in the middle worked well because it stood out and made the most important bit of information visible. I don't like the lines with each country's percentage; I think it is too cluttered and overwhelming to look at. I also feel like the title is a bit unclear and could be more explanatory of what the graph is trying to convey.

I think the primary audience is people interested in getting a pet and choosing a type. I think the graph doesn't necessarily make it very clear what its purpose is due to the title. If it switched to something like "The most common household pets," it would be more clear on what the graph is stating.

With my redesign, I will  focus on making the data more simplified and clear. The main data by country is cluttered and isn't easily comparable or readable. I want to try to make it more visual so you can compare the percentages opposed to it being primarily text. I am excited to try different style graphs, such as a scatter plot, bar graph, or line graph.  

## Step three: Sketch a solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1762712367154' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Percent of households living with types of pets ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesign_17626407652850&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CritiquebyDesign_17626407652850&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesign_17626407652850&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1762712367154');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions: 

1 What is the first thing you noticed when you looked at this graph?

2 What do you think the purpose of the graph is?

3 What information can you infer from this graph?

4 What do you like or dislike about this graph?

5 Is there anything you would like to see changed on this graph?

Results: 


Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1762963243984' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Percentage of households living with pets by country ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesignAfter&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CritiquebyDesignAfter&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesignAfter&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1762963243984');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
