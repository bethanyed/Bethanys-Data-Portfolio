# Critique by Design

## Step one: the visualization

When choosing a visual for this redesign, I was drawn to this one for several reasons. The first thing that caught my attention was the data. I have a lot of pets and it interested me to see the trends in pet ownership around the world. Secondly, while I thought the main information of the overall averages was portrayed well, I thought the rest of the graph seemed cluttered. So I thought that a redesign could help improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend.

## Step two: the critique
Overall, the colors were what mainly stood out to me, as well as the visual icons they utilized. I think having the averages in the middle worked well because it stood out and made the most important bit of information visible. I don't like the lines with each country's percentage; I think it is too cluttered and overwhelming to look at. I also feel like the title is a bit unclear and could be more explanatory of what the graph is trying to convey.

I think the primary audience is people interested in getting a pet and choosing a type. I think the graph doesn't necessarily make it very clear what its purpose is due to the title. If it switched to something like "The most common household pets," it would be more clear on what the graph is stating.

With my redesign, I will  focus on making the data more simplified and clear. The main data by country is cluttered and isn't easily comparable or readable. I want to try to make it more visual so you can compare the percentages opposed to it being primarily text. I am excited to try different style graphs, such as a scatter plot, bar graph, or line graph.  

## Step three: Sketch a solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1762712367154' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Percent of households living with types of pets ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesign_17626407652850&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CritiquebyDesign_17626407652850&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesign_17626407652850&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1762712367154');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions: 

1 What is the first thing you noticed when you looked at this graph?

2 What do you think the purpose of the graph is?

3 What information can you infer from this graph?

4 What do you like or dislike about this graph?

5 Is there anything you would like to see changed on this graph?

Results: 
<img src="Screenshot 2025-11-12 173912.jpg" width="1000"/>

Synthesis: 
One of the major patterns that emerged from my interviews was that many of the interviewees were drawn to the data regarding the dogs. 3 out of 6 interviewees stated that the first thing they noticed was the large spike in dogs, on top of that, 5 out of 6 interviewees answered "What information can you infer from this graph?" with a variation of "dogs and cats are most common." This was an important note for my research because the goal of he graph is to represent the most common pets. 

Next to that, 4 interviewees stated they think a different style of graph may better represent the data and make it easier to compare. 1 interviewee specifically mentioned that dots on the lines may make it easier to note each specific data point. 

On top of that, the main notes throughout had to do with specific formatting regarding the headline, x-axis, and y-axis. Some adjustments included making the headline bold, spreading the axis out further for readability, or increasing the size of the key. The most popular visual feature was the color, with one interviewee noting that it was colorblind friendly.

Overall, the graph was well-received, and the data was easily interpreted for its intended purpose. People noted the high percentage of cats and dogs, as well as some people noting the low pet population in Turkey. Most of the recommendations or notes were minor about formatting and layout. The colors were the most popular aspect of the graph.

## Step five: build the solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1762963243984' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Percentage of households living with pets by country ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesignAfter&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CritiquebyDesignAfter&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cr&#47;CritiquebyDesignAfter&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1762963243984');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

For my redesign, I focused on readability and ease of interpretation. My first edit included making the headline bold as well as modifying it so it could be slightly clearer on the data. I also spread the x-axis out further to make each country name fully visible. As recommended by an interviewee, I rearranged the overall average point to be at the front of the graph so that it is the first data point. 

I took the one recommendation about adding dots to the lines and adjusted this to be a dot plot instead. Since the points weren't intended to be connected, I decided that a line graph didn't make the most sense, but the interview mentioning adding dots inspired me to make it a dot plot. 

Overall, my entire process started with some research and choosing a data set that interested me. I spent a lot of time reviewing the original graph and trying to decide the best method to portray this data in a way that makes it easily comparable. I had initially chosen a line graph but later decided a dot plot made more sense. I wanted to ensure this graph was easily readable and easy to interpret, which from the interviews, I felt I achieved for the most part. I really enjoyed using the critique methods to break down the original graph and determine what was effective versus what was ineffective.
